# Specification of Function

Basically Users should be able to upload 2 images to a folder (or even better yet the program asks them to select 2 images), the program then displays the both images and asks for the user to click them. On click (x,y) are registered. The distance between the 2 points is found. 

Things to be aware of:
* size of the photos should be the same, (how to get image proportions?)
* name of photos affects their import (unless you can find a way to circumvent it)
* output is (delta_x, delta_y)
