# 20-20-replacement

# Specification of Function

Basically Users should be able to upload 2 images to a folder (or even better yet the program asks them to select 2 images), the program then displays the first image and asks for the user to click it. On click (x,y) are registered. The process is repeated for the second image, and the distance between the 2 points is found. 

Things to be aware of:
* size of the photos should be the same, (how to get image proportions?)
* name of photos affects their import (unless you can find a way to circumvent it)
* different outputs, how should it be formatted? (photo 2 should be moved 30px down 500 px left) or what?
